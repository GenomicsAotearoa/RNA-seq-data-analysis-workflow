## Getting started with RNA-seq data analysis

This workshop aims to get you started with analysing your own RNA-seq data by providing an example workflow. At each of the major steps in the workflow we will examine issues that could confound your analysis and consider how different available methods address these issues. 

Rather than prescribing what methods you should use, this workshop aims to make the user aware of the biological and statistical challenges involved in analysing RNA-seq data and asks how different methods address those challenges. By the end of this workshop you should be familiar with the general workflow of RNA-seq analysis and be ready to ask informed questions about the specific methods you should select going forward. 

This workshop is written in the form of a workshop which will run over two mornings from 9am - 1pm. The workshop includes a small example dataset which will be used by the workshop Instructor to demonstrate an analysis. Attendees may choose to follow along with the analysis in real time or they may choose to focus on note-taking. The workshop includes short exercises to highlight key messages and reinforce your understanding. 



## Workshop timeline

This workshop runs over two mornings, from 9am - 1pm. We will take one 15 minute break at approximately 10:45, and shorter breaks in between. 

### Day 1

#### [An overview of RNA-seq data analysis workflows](background.qmd)  
#### [Quality assessment](episode_1.qmd#quality-assessment-with-fastqc)  
#### [Adaptor trimming and filtering](episode_1.qmd#cleaning-reads)  
#### [Mapping and counting methods](episode_2.qmd)  
#### [Exploratory analysis](episode_3.qmd)

### Day 2

#### [Concepts for identifying differentially expressed genes](episode_4.qmd)  
#### [Limma for differentially expressed genes](episode_4.qmd#identifying-differentially-expressed-genes-using-limma)  
#### [DESeq2 for differentially expressed genes](episode_4.qmd#identifying-differentially-expressed-genes-using-deseq2)  
#### [Over-representation analysis](episode_5.qmd)  


## Setup

During the workshop, code will be run in real-time to demonstrate the analysis. This will be run on the REANNZ OpenOnDemand platform which already has all the required software and R packages installed. 



## Attribution notice

This workshop is an updated version on an existing version of [RNA-seq data analysis by Genomics Aotearoa and REANNZ (formerly NeSI)](https://genomicsaotearoa.github.io/RNA-seq-workshop-on-demand/). It incorporates, and takes inspiration from, various training materials produced by the [Harvard Bioinformatics Core](https://github.com/hbctraining) and from The Carpentries, specifically their [RNA-seq analysis with Bioconductor workshop](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/bioc-rnaseq/index.html).
